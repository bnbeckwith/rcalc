* Tasks

** Basic Functionality

   These are the clocked tasks for the RPN calculator

*** DONE Print out header
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-24 Mon 15:57]--[2015-08-24 Mon 16:00] =>  0:03
    :END:

    Print out a small header with version information.

*** DONE Incorporate readline for input
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-24 Mon 16:01]--[2015-08-24 Mon 16:08] =>  0:07
    :END:

    Require readline and produce a basic REPL.

*** DONE Create line tokens
    CLOSED: [2015-08-24 Mon 16:47]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-24 Mon 16:47]
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-24 Mon 16:41]--[2015-08-24 Mon 16:47] =>  0:06
    :END:

    Using the REPL, grab a line and tokenize it.

*** DONE Evaluate stack until only one operand left
    CLOSED: [2015-08-25 Tue 14:07]
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-25 Tue 14:07]
    :END:
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-24 Mon 16:48]--[2015-08-24 Mon 16:57] =>  0:09
    :END:

    After tokenizing, push values on the stack and evaluate operations.

*** DONE Figure out how to evaluate operands
    CLOSED: [2015-08-24 Mon 16:58]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-24 Mon 16:58]
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-24 Mon 16:57]--[2015-08-24 Mon 17:00] =>  0:03
    :END:

    Using the =send= method, I can pass on the string operations on the
    numerical objects and arguments. The Smalltalk shows through here.

*** DONE How to pop off of the stack?
    CLOSED: [2015-08-24 Mon 17:02]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-24 Mon 17:02]
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-24 Mon 16:58]--[2015-08-24 Mon 17:03] =>  0:05
    :END:

    This is a simple pop like Perl.

*** DONE Convert operands to proper numbers
    CLOSED: [2015-08-25 Tue 14:04]
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-25 Tue 14:04]
    :END:
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-25 Tue 11:44]--[2015-08-25 Tue 11:55] =>  0:11
    CLOCK: [2015-08-24 Mon 22:56]--[2015-08-24 Mon 22:59] =>  0:03
    :END:

    I'll need to do the following

    - [X] Float
    - [X] Int
    - [X] Complex
    - [X] Hex/Bin/Octal


    What if I just look for a /numberish/ thing and eval that component
    to let the parser return the value.  I don't have to write my own
    parser and can rely on the ruby input types.

    What is numberish?  Anything that starts with a digit optionally
    preceeded by a +/-.

    /[+-]?[0-9]/

    I can transform the whole line and then the operands are the
    strings that are left.

    I'll use =eval= here for now to avoid creating my own number
    parser.

*** DONE Handle exceptions
    CLOSED: [2015-08-25 Tue 14:48]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-25 Tue 14:48]
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-25 Tue 14:32]--[2015-08-25 Tue 14:48] =>  0:16
    :END:

    Exceptions that I expect:

    - Not enough operands
    - No method
    - Numeric conversion
    - No operands
   
     
*** DONE Produce error on too many items left in the stack
    CLOSED: [2015-08-26 Wed 09:24]
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-26 Wed 09:24]
    :END:

    This is a case of too few operations specified.



** Command-line improvements

*** DONE Print usage
    CLOSED: [2015-08-26 Wed 09:40]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-26 Wed 09:40]
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-26 Wed 09:37]--[2015-08-26 Wed 09:40] =>  0:03
    :END:
*** TODO Accept streaming input 
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-30 Sun 22:24]--[2015-08-30 Sun 22:32] =>  0:08
    :END:
*** DONE Accept string input
    CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 12:33]
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-31 Mon 12:33]
    :END:
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-26 Wed 09:34]--[2015-08-26 Wed 09:37] =>  0:03
    :END:

** Readline improvments

*** DONE Add in history
    CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 16:47]
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "DONE"       [2015-08-31 Mon 16:49]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-31 Mon 16:47]
    :END:
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-31 Mon 12:45]--[2015-08-31 Mon 13:00] =>  0:15
    :END:

    Because it is Readline, the history is added automatically for
    entered strings.

    I would like to enter in the last result to history for retrieval.

*** DONE Put cursor at right spot for errors
    CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 21:57]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-31 Mon 21:57]
    :CLOCK:
    CLOCK: [2015-08-31 Mon 21:32]--[2015-08-31 Mon 21:57] =>  0:25
    CLOCK: [2015-08-31 Mon 16:30]--[2015-08-31 Mon 17:05] =>  0:35
    :END:

    I need to move around some code to make this happen. Here's what I
    see needs to be done:

    - [X] Create custom error with token index
    - [X] Catch other specific errors for messages
    - [X] Put error line back in Readline (using pre_input_hook)
    - [X] Put cursor in the right spot on error
